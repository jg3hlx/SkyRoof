## Features

SkyRoof combines satellite tracking and SDR functions in one application, which opens some interesting possibilities.
<br>
For example, all satellite traces on the waterfall are labeled with satellite names, the boundaries of the transponder
<br>
segments follow the Doppler shift, and all frequency tuning is done visually, with a mouse.

The main features of SkyRoof are:

- detailed information about all satellites that transmit in the Ham bands;
- satellite tracking in real time;
- pass prediction for the selected satellites;
- visual representation of the current satellite position and future passes, using:
  - Sky View - the view of the sky from your location;
  - Earth View - the view of the Earth from the satellite;
  - Time Line - the satellite passes on the time scale;
  - Pass List - the details of the predicted passes;
- SDR-based waterfall display that covers the whole satellite segments on the VHF and UHF bands, with zoom and pan;
- SDR-based SSB/CW/FM receiver with RIT and Doppler tracking;
- audio and I/Q output to external programs via VAC or UDP;
- frequency scale with satellite names and transponder segments, Doppler-corrected;
- CAT control of an external transceiver;
- antenna rotator control.

The program can work without an SDR, or even without any radio at all, but many useful functions are not available in this mode.

# Data Folder

SkyRoof keeps all of its data in the **data folder**.

- Click on **Help / Data Folder** in the main menu to open this folder in File Explorer.
- To open the folder when the program is not running, type this in File Explorer:

    ```bash
    %appdata%\Afreet\Products\SkyRoof`
    ```

## Data Files

- **Settings.json** - this is the file where all user-defined settings are stored;

- **amsat_sat_names.json** - satellite names used on
    [AMSAT Live OSCAR Satellite Status Page](https://www.amsat.org/status/). The
    [Frequency Scale](frequency_scale.md) section explains how to post your observations
    to this page;

- **lotw_sat_names.json** - the list of satellite abbreviations accepted by
    [LoTW](https://www.arrl.org/quick-start);

- **Satellites.json** - the satellite database compiled from the downloaded data;

- **transmitters-override.json** - hand-curated corrections to the transmitter
    [signal parameters](satellite_data.md#signal-parameters). Ships with a default set that SkyRoof
    keeps up to date; mark an entry `"read_only": true` to protect your own edits;

- **cat_info.json** - lists the CAT capabilities of a generic simplex radio;

- **wsjtx_wisdom.dat** - optimal FFT transform settings found by automatic testing.

## Folders

- **Logs** - contains the log files with error messages and other information;
- **Adif** - QSO records stored in the ADIF format;
- **Downloads** - a copy of the satellite data downloaded from various sources, kept for troubleshooting;
- **Palettes** - definition of the color palettes used by the waterfall display. Add your own
    palette as a text file with "html" color codes. Pick the color codes at
    [htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/);
- **sat_images** - cached satellite thumbnails shown by the
    [Satellite Photo](satellite_photo.md) widget. Delete this folder to force re-download;
- **Recordings** - the default location for the audio and I/Q files saved by the
    [Recorder](recorder_panel.md) panel;
- **FT4** - decoded messages saved by the [FT4 Console](ft4_console_panel.md) panel, when the
    **Save to File** option is enabled in the settings;
- **TelemetryDecodes** - decoded telemetry frames saved by the [Telemetry](telemetry_panel.md)
    panel, when the **Save to File** option is enabled in the
    [telemetry settings](setting_up_telemetry_decoding.md#decoder-settings). One file is created per day,
    and each line is stamped with both UTC and local time;
- **SstvImages** - [SSTV images](recevie_sstv.md) decoded by the [Telemetry](telemetry_panel.md)
    panel, saved automatically as PNG files with a JSON metadata sidecar;
- **SsdvImages** - [images received as SSDV packets or as raw JPEG fragments](receive_ssdv.md),
    decoded by the [Telemetry](telemetry_panel.md) panel, saved automatically as JPEG files with a
    JSON metadata sidecar. The sidecar also holds the received packets, which is what lets a picture
    be [combined with its earlier receptions](receive_ssdv.md#combining-passes);
- **Codec2Voice** - [Codec2 voice messages](receive_voice.md) decoded by the
    [Telemetry](telemetry_panel.md) panel, saved automatically as WAV files with a JSON metadata
    sidecar;
- **TelemetryRegistry** - the definitions used to decode raw telemetry frames into named values
    in the [Telemetry](telemetry_panel.md) panel.

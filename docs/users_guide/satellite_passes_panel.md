# Satellite Passes

The Satellite Passes panel shows the list of predicted satellite passes over your location:

The radio buttons at the top allow you to view either the passes of the selected satellite, of all satellites
in the currently selected groups, or all satellites carrying a VHF or UHF downlink transmitter and thus
visible on the [Frequency Scale](frequency_scale.md).

Click on a pass to make the satellite selected and to view its trajectory on the
[Sky View panel](sky_view_panel.md).

Move the cursor over the satellite name to view extra information on the mouse tooltip, or right-click to open
the [Satellite Details window](satellite_details_window.md).

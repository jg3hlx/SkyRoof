    "summary": "SkyRoof v.1.20 beta A Windows application for Hams and satellite enthusiasts open source Copyright © 2025 Alex Shovkoplyas, VE3NEA Features SkyRoof combines satellite tracking and SDR functions in one application, which opens some interesting possibilities. For example, all satellite traces on the waterfall are labeled with satellite names, the boundaries of the transponder segments follow the Doppler shift, and all frequency tuning is done visually, with a mouse. The main features of SkyRoof are: detailed information about all satellites that transmit in the Ham bands; satellite tracking in real time; pass prediction for the selected satellites; visual representation of the current satellite position and future passes, using: Sky View - the view of the sky from your location; Earth View - the view of the Earth from the satellite; Time Line - the satellite passes on the time scale; Pass List - the details of the predicted passes; SDR-based waterfall display that covers the whole satellite segments on the VHF and UHF bands, with zoom and pan; SDR-based SSB/CW/FM receiver with RIT and Doppler tracking; audio and I/Q output to external programs via VAC or UDP; frequency scale with satellite names and transponder segments, Doppler-corrected; CAT control of an external transceiver; antenna rotator control. The program can work without an SDR, or even without any radio at all, but many useful functions are not available in this mode.

    "title": "Calibrating PPM Correction | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "Calibrating PPM Correction Motivation The clock frequency of an SDR, as it comes from the factory, is rarely accurate. Typical errors are in the range of a few PPM (parts per million), which translates to a tuning error of 1-2 Khz on the 70 cm band. For accurate tracking of the satellite signals this error must be calibrated out. The calibration process is simple, we just find a signal of known frequency, check on what frequecy it appears on the waterfall, and compute the PPM correction factor from the difference between the two. There are plenty of signals on the air that may be used for calibration, if one knows what to look for. One of such signals is the FCCH channel of a GSM downlink. This channel is located 67,708 Hz above the center frequency of a GSM channel, and the accuracy of its frequency is claimed to be better than 0.05 PPM. 3-rd Party Software For the RTL-SDR dongles you can use the Kalibrate utility that performs such calibration automatically. For other radios follow the steps below. Steps Find a strong GSM signal, or any other signal of known frequency. In my area one of such signals is present on 890.8 MHz. Click on the Downlink frequency display in the Frequency Control panel on the toolbar to open the frequency entry dialog: Enter the frequency of the channel plus the FCCH offset: 890,800,000 + 67,708 = 890,867,708 Hz Click on the Tune button in the dialog and verify that the SDR is tuned to the desired frequency: Zoom in by spinning the mouse wheel over the waterfall display: Find the FCCH signal. On the screenshot below it is about 4 kHz above the expected frequency: Now let us measure the offset between the receiver frequency (the center of the green rectangle that represents the receiver passband) and the FCCH frequency. Tick the RIT checkbox on the Frequency Control panel and adjust the RIT offset until the RIT passband (the clear rectangle) aligns with the signal. You can tune RIT in many different ways, as described in the Frequency Control and Frequency Scale sections. For now, just use the up/down buttons in the RIT offset box, or spin the mouse wheel over that box. Compute the PPM correction. The frequency error measured in the previous step is 3,760 Hz, so the PPM is: 3,760 / 890,867,708 * 1e6 = 4.22 PPM Now enter this value in the SDR Devices dialog, and you are done."

    "summary": "Configuring the Window Layout The layout of SkyRoof's main window is under your full control. Any panel may be shown or hidden, docked anywhere in the window, or left floating. Show and Hide Show the panels using the menu commands in the View section, hide them using the same command again, or by clicking on the Close button on panel's caption bar. Docking The panels you open are initially in the floating state. This is not very convenient as you cannot move or resize the main window without breaking your panel arrangement. You can dock the panels so that they move and resize when you move/resize the main window. How to Dock a Floating Panel The Timeline panel in the screenshot below is floating. Let us dock it to the bottom of the main window. Find the Panel's Title Bar Locate the top bar of the floating panel labeled \"Timeline\". This is known as the title bar. Click and Hold Move your mouse cursor to the title bar and press the left mouse button. Keep holding the button down. Drag the Panel While holding the mouse button, move the panel by dragging it with the mouse. As you begin to drag, you will see dock target icons appear in the main window—these icons represent the available docking positions. You will also notice a dimmed rectangle showing where the panel would be docked if released. ⚠️ Important: This rectangle is only a visual preview. Do not try to align it with the dock target icon. Instead, focus on where your mouse cursor is. Position the Mouse Cursor Over a Dock Target Icon Move your mouse cursor over one of the dock target icons (not the rectangle). The docking location will update automatically. The panel will only dock if the cursor is directly over the icon. Release to Dock Once the cursor is over your desired dock target icon, release the mouse button. The panel will snap into place — either at the side, in the center, or nested inside another panel, depending on the selected icon. Once docked, the panel becomes part of the main window layout, helping keep your workspace clean and organized. Auto-Hide A panel can be switched to the auto-hide mode, which allows it to stay hidden until you click on its tab. In the screenshot below, notice the \"Timeline\" tab in the bottom-left corner. Clicking this tab temporarily slides the Timeline panel into view. To enable auto-hide mode, click the Auto-Hide button located on the panel’s title bar. Tabbing You can also organize panels as tabs. If you drop one panel directly onto another, they will be grouped into a tabbed interface. In the screenshot below the Sky View Panel and Earth View Panel have been combined into a tabbed view. You can switch between these panels by clicking on their respective tabs."

    "summary": "Doppler Tracking The SGP4 algorithm used in SkyRoof to compute the Doppler offset produces very accurate results for the LEO satellites, typically within tens of Hertz, if it receives accurate input data. For best results, ensure that the following conditions are met. Home Location Make sure that your grid square is accurate. Correct it in the Settings window if necessary. System Time Your system clock should be accurate to a second. Get one of those little programs that run in the system tray and periodically synchronize your clock with the time servers on the Internet. NetTime is one such program. PPM correction Find the PPM correction factor of your SDR radio as described in the Calibrating PPM Correction section and enter it in SDR settings. TLE Data SkyRoof downloads the TLE data automatically every 24 hours. Some sources claim that TLE may be updated once a week, but that would not be enough for accurate Doppler tracking, especially for the satellites that perform frequent orbit corrections. When in doubt, download TLE manually as described in the Satellite Data section. Transmitter Frequency Correction Most satellite transmitters transmit on the frequencies that differ from the nominal values by up to a few kHz. A one-time correction described in the Frequency Control and Frequency Scale sections eliminates this error."

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "Frequently Asked Questions Q: I downloaded SkyRoof, and my virus scanner shows an infection. Is it real? A: Most likely, it is a false detection. However, it is always a good idea to test the download links before downloading any software. There are several online virus scanning services that you can use to check the link. VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis are just two examples. Copy the download link and paste it in the virus scanner page. The scanner will download the file, test it with multiple antivirus programs, and show you the results. In the screenshot below the download link of SkyRoof 1.5 beta was tested with VirtusTotal, and all virus scanners, except one, agreed that the file was clean. When you see something like this, you know that it was a false alarm. If the file is clean, you can add it to the exception list of your virus scanner and safely install it. For Windows Defender follow these instructions, for other anti-virus products follow the instructions in their documentation. To prevent such problems in the future, please submit the file to Microsoft for analysis using this link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission Q: The right part of the SkyRoof toolbar does not fit in the screen, even though the screen resolution is 1980x1280. A: This happens because your text size setting in Windows is too high. For example, if it is set to 200%, the effective screen width is only 1900 / 2 = 950 pixels. To fix this, right-click on the Desktop, click on Display Settings and set the text size to a lower value. Q: How can I run two instances of SkyRoof? A: By default, only one instance of SkyRoof can run at any time, but there is a work around. Make a copy of the SkyRoof.exe file in the same folder, but with a different name, e.g., SkyRoof_2.exe. Each exe will have its own settings, its own data folder, and will run independently of the other instance. Q: I found an error in the satellite database: one of the satellite transmitters is marked as active, while it has been inactive for years. How can I correct the error? A: SkyRoof uses satellite data from the SatNOGS database. This database is crowd-sourced, so anyone can suggest changes. If you find an error in a satellite record (shown in the Satellite Details and Satellite Transmitters panels), click on the \"SatNOGS\" link in the Satellite Details panel to open the SatNOGS web site, then click on Transmitters, and select Edit from the drop-down menu. You may need to create an account with them (free) in order to submit changes. Q: How can I add a satellite that is currently not listed in SkyRoof? A: The only way to add a satellite to SkyRoof is to add it to the SatNOGS database. Here is how you can do this: navigate to the SatNOGS DB web site; click on Sign Up / Log In in the top right corner of the page; create a free account, or log in to an existing one; click on All Satellites; in the Actions drop-down list select *Suggest New Satellite. See this Wiki page for details. Q: My video card does not have an OpenGL 3.3 driver. Is there a way to use a software-only implementation of OpenGL? A: Some users have had success with the OpenGL 3.3 functionality implemented in the software, though this solution is very CPU-intensive. You can try this or this solution. Download the 64-bit version of the library and extract all DLL's from the archive to the SkyRoof folder. Q: How do I prevent CTCSS from turning off when using SkyRoof with FM satellites and an Icom radio? A: If you're experiencing an issue where the CTCSS tone turns off when transmitting or changing frequencies with SkyRoof and an Icom radio, the solution is to disable the \"Auto Repeater\" setting in the radio. This setting causes the radio to automatically disable repeater-related features like CTCSS when the frequency is changed, assuming you're no longer on a repeater. Disabling \"Auto Repeater\" prevents this behavior and keeps CTCSS enabled during frequency changes. This workaround was highlighted in a helpful YouTube video. Q: What are all those offset settings for? A: Downlink Manual Correction: the frequencies of most satellite transmitters slightly differ from their published values. The purpose of this setting is to compensate for the difference, you set it once for each satellite and never change it again; RIT: just as in any HF radio, it is used to quickly switch the receiver between two frequencies close to each other. A typical use case is when someone answers your CQ slightly off the frequency and you want to tune to it without changing your main operating frequency; Uplink Manual Correction: this setting allows you to precisely align your own signal received back from the satellite with your receiver frequency. It needs to be set only once per satellite, and the offset is usually very small; Transponder Offset: the position of your operating frequency within the transponder passband. This offset is included in the Corrected Downlink Frequency shown on the toolbar, the actual value of the offset is shown only on the mouse tooltip of the frequency display. There are many ways to tune within the transponder passband, such as click on the desired frequency, drag the green passband rectangle, spin the mouse wheel over the rectangle, etc. These methods work only when the transponder is selected in the Transmitter drop-down box. Doppler correction: this correction is computed and applied automatically, it keeps your RX and TX signals in sync when you tune through the transponder segment. Q: How to troubleshoot the rotator control? A: Set up and enable rotator control as described in Setting Up Rotator Control. if the Rotator light on the status bar is red, the problem is with the SkyRoof to rotctld.exe connection; if the light is green, then the SkyRoof to rotcltd.exe connection is fine, the problem is with the rotctld.exe to rotor connection. Add the -vvvvv option to the command line that starts rotctld.exe, and restart it. This option tells rotctld.exe to print detailed information to the console window (the black window that opens when rotctld.exe is started). Read the rotctld.exe documentation that will help you to understand information in the console window. Possible causes of SkyRoof to rotctld.exe connection problems: rotctld.exe failed to start; SkyRoof is configured to use a port number different from the rotctld.exe listening port. Possible causes of the rotctld.exe to rotator connection error problems: the rotator is not connected to the computer or not powered on; the COM port number or Baud rate specified on the command line is wrong - then the COM port fails to open; the rotator model specified on the command line is wrong - then the commands sent to the rotor are rejected or have no effect. Make rotator control work without SkyRoof first: use rotctl.exe, an interactive version of rotctld.exe, and send commands to the rotator manually, by typing them in the console window. Rotator control uses three commands, \"P\", \"p\" and \"S\" (set position, read position, stop rotation). Once you make rotctl.exe work with the rotator, run rotctld.exe with the same command line parameters."

    "summary": "Frequency Control Frequency Control is the panel on the toolbar that allows you to read and control the frequencies of the SDR receiver, external receiver and external transmitter: Downlink The left hand part of the panel represents the receiver settings that apply to both SDR and external radio. Label When the receiver is tuned to a downlink transmitter of some satellite, the label \"Downlink\" appears; when it is tuned to a terrestrial station, the label \"Terrestrial\" is displayed. To tune to a downlink, select some satellite in the Satellite Selector panel, or select a different transmitter from the drop-down list, or click on the satellite name in any panel. To tune to a terrestrial signal, click on it on the Waterfall Display or on the Frequency Scale, or click on the downlink frequency display and enter the frequency in the Tune to Frequency window: Mode Select the mode manually for every satellite transmitter that you are using. Your selection is remembered and restored when the transmitter is selected again. The Mode selected in the drop-down box applies to the SDR receiver, if it is enabled, and to the external receiver, if RX CAT is enabled. To enable or disable the SDR or RX CAT, click on the corresponding label on the status bar. Frequency Display The frequency display shows either the nominal frequency of the downlink, or the frequency with all corrections applied. Right-click on the display to switch between the two frequencies. The mouse tooltip of the frequency display shows both frequencies and some other details. When RX CAT is enabled and working properly, the frequency is shown in a bright color, otherwise the display is dimmed. The color depends on the band: yellow/olive for VHF, cyan/teal for UHF, white/gray for all other bands. Doppler The Doppler box shows the current Doppler offset of the downlink signal. This value is not editable, but Doppler correction may be enabled or disabled using the checkbox. See the Doppler Tracking section for a detailed discussion of Doppler offset calculation and tracking. Manual The manual correction of the downlink frequency. The frequencies of the satellite downlink signals usually differ from the nominal values in the database, for different reasons, by a few hundred Hertz and up to a couple of kilohertz. This difference is pretty stable, so it is enough to enter the correction once to have the receiver accurately tuned. SkyRoof remembers the manual correction for each satellite. The value of the manual correction may be entered in the Manual box by clicking on the up/down buttons, or by spinning the mouse wheel over the box, or by typing the value directly. However, it is more convenient to adjust the correction visually, using the mouse on the Frequency Scale. The checkbox allows you to disable the manual correction if necessary. RIT The RIT function is useful when listening to a conversation of two stations that are not exactly on the same frequency, or when your CQ is answered off the frequency. The RIT offset may be entered in the RIT box, but it is more convenient to control it on the Frequency Scale. Use the checkbox, or the commands on the Frequency Scale, to toggle RIT. Uplink The Uplink part of the panel is similar to the Downlink part described above. It is enabled only if the selected satellite transmitter has an uplink. The bright color of the frequency display means that TX CAT is enabled and working properly. The Transmit button switches the external radio between the RX and TX modes. The Manual Correction setting of the uplink allows you to align your transmit and receive frequencies. See the Frequency Scale section for details. Dial Knob The dial knob of the transceiver can be used to tune the frequency when CAT control is enabled and the Ignore Dial Knob option is set to false. When both RX CAT and TX CAT are enabled, the dial knob controls the receiver frequency. Note When the radio is in the SAT mode, the NOR/REV switch should be in the NOR position for correct tuning with the dial knob."

The satellite labels appear about 5 minutes before the AOS, and stay for a while after LOS, so that the existing signal traces could be identified, but then they disappear. This also applies to the linear satellites and their transponder segments. When the segment is not visible, you cannot tune within it using the mouse controls. The operator tunes in the transponder segment to tune to some station, or to find a clear space to send CQ. If the satellite is below the horizon, this, of course, cannot be done, and if you are still using the tuning commands, the program assumes that you are trying to do something else, e.g., tune to a terrestrial signal. SDR Receiver The passband of the SDR receiver is shown on the frequency scale as a green rectangle. To tune the receiver: click on one of the satellite labels to start tracking satellite's transmitter; click within a blue transponder segment to select the transmitter and set the transponder offset; click anywhere on the frequency scale to tune to a terrestrial signal; drag the green rectangle to another frequency with a mouse; spin the mouse wheel on or near the green rectangle. The effect of tuning depends on the transmitter selection: when tuned to a terrestrial signal, tuning the SDR receiver just changes the receiver frequency; when a satellite transmitter is tracked, tuning adjusts the Manual Offset of the satellite (see below); if a satellite transponder is selected, tuning changes the receiver offset within the transponder segment. Another way to tune the SDR receiver is to use the Frequency Control on the toolbar. If RX CAT is enabled, tuning the SDR receiver also tunes the external radio to the same frequency. Note Get a mouse with a free-spinning wheel, such as Logitech MX Master 3S, this makes tuning much easier. Manual Offset The Manual Offset setting compensates for the transmitter frequency error, see Frequency Control and Doppler Tracking for details. The offset value is usually the same for all transmitters of a satellite, adjust it for some non-transponder transmitter before using the transponder. Most satellites with a transponder also carry a telemetry or beacon transmitter that you can use to set the manual offset: Aligning The Uplink and Downlink Frequencies The screenshot below shows how to set Manual Correction for the uplink and downlink for a linear transponder, such as RS-44. Select the beacon transmitter of the satellite and adjust the Downlink Manual Correction setting to align the transmitter label and its signal trace on the waterfall. For RS-44 the required correction is about -1900 Hz. If your offset is different, then yor SDR requires PPM calibration. Select the transponder transmitter and find a clear frequency within the transponder segment. Send a sequence of dots and adjust the Uplink Manual Correction to align the center of the green rectangle with the trace of your signals coming from the satellite. These adjustments need to be done only once. They stay the same, within a few tens of Hertz, between the satellite passes. When TX CAT is enabled, RX CAT is disabled and the Ignore Dial Knob is set to false in the Settings, it is possible to adjust the Uplink Manual Offset using the dial knob on the radio. RIT While the RIT function could be controlled using the Frequency Control panel, it is more convenient to do this on the frequency scale: When RIT is enabled, the clear rectangle shows the current receiver passband, while the green rectangle stays on the main frequency. spin the mouse wheel on or near the green rectangle while holding the Ctrl key down: this enables RIT and tunes its offset; spin the mouse wheel on or near the green rectangle WITHOUT holding the Ctrl key down: this disables RIT and tunes the main frequency; right-click on or near the green rectangle to turn RIT on and off. Resizing Adjust the height of the frequency scale by dragging the splitter between the scale and the waterfall:"

    "summary": "How to Receive FSK & AFSK Telemetry and other info using UZ7HO packet radio TNCs by Marcus PY2PLL An external program is needed to decode and display common information usually disseminated using FSK or AFSK. In this tutorial the UZ7HO sound modems will be used. More information about these modems can be found at the UZ7HO Personal page under Packet-Radio - English version. Installing VAC A virtual audio cable, VAC, is required to pass the satellite signals demodulated in SkyRoof to the decoding program. Download and install VB-Audio if you do not have it yet, and reboot your system. Be sure to get the latest version (2024) of VB-Audio, the old version may not work correctly. Setting Up The Sound Modems Download and extract zipped files content to new folders -- one folder for each executable -- somewhere on your PC storage. For AFSK, e.g. the common modes for APRS, AX-25, 1200bps packet and other similar modes, use this low speed modem; for the higher speeds and formats such as 9600/19200 G3RUH FSK, etc., use this high speed modem Sometimes there is false virus detection or unsafe download alert from some web browsers. As already recommended in the SkyRoof FAQ, scan both links using one of the several online virus scanning services that you can use to check the link. P.S.: there are a few extra modems that can be tested for other modulation formats such as BPSK, GMSK. etc. in this archieve. But this How-To only covers AFSK and FSK associated to FM_D SkyRoof mode. For the UZ7HO itself, there is a more detailed user guide at Soundmodem User Guide v114 Once downloaded and extracted, create corresponding desktop shortcuts to easy programs launch; The following examples will cover Veronika or Tigrisat satellites FSK data; Configure the sound modems audio setup using the already installed VACs. This setup is under Settings => Devices tab. Despite the fact that those modems can be used to TX and RX, the sample picture below assumes that the use is RX only; Select FSK G3RUH 9600bd in one of the drop down menus and adjust DCD slider up to the point that the \"led\" blinks a little bit. Configuring SkyRoof In SkyRoof: select the Veronika satellite.

    "summary": "Overview SkyRoof is an open source, 64-bit Windows application for Hams and satellite enthusiasts, available on the terms of the GPL v.3 license. It combines satellite tracking and SDR functions in one program, which opens some interesting possibilities. For example, all satellite traces on the waterfall are labeled with satellite names, the boundaries of the transponder segments follow the Doppler shift, and all frequency tuning is done visually, with a mouse. Features The main features of SkyRoof are: detailed information about all satellites that transmit in the Ham bands; satellite tracking in real time; pass prediction for the selected satellites; visual representation of the current satellite position and future passes, using: Sky View - the view of the sky from your location; Earth View - the view of the Earth from the satellite; Time Line - the satellite passes on the time scale; Pass List - the details of the predicted passes; SDR-based waterfall display that covers the whole satellite segments on the VHF and UHF bands, with zoom and pan; SDR-based SSB/CW/FM receiver with RIT and Doppler tracking; audio and I/Q output to external programs via VAC or UDP; frequency scale with satellite names and transponder segments, Doppler-corrected; CAT control of an external transceiver; antenna rotator control. The program can work without an SDR, or even without any radio at all, but many useful functions are not available in this mode."

User Information Input You will be presented with the User Details dialog: Enter your callsign, 6-character grid square and your altitude above the sea level. The grid square is required, the program cannot proceed without that information. The other two values are optional. Satellite Data Download Then SkyRoof downloads the satellite data: make sure that your computer is connected to the Internet. Wait until the data are downloaded and imported. Again, SkyRoof cannot proceed without this data downloaded at least once, so if you click on Cancel, the program terminates. FFT Setup Wait for SkyRoof to try different ways of computing the FFT transform and to find the one that works best on your system. This may take quite some time! That's all for the quick start! Now you can use the program for tracking the satellites in frequency and space, and for predicting the satellite passes over your location. To do more than that, you have to perform the rest of the setup steps described in the next sections."

Receiving SSTV Find out when the next SSTV activity on ISS will take place, usually it happens every few months and lasts for up to a week. One good source of information about such activities is the ARISS web site. You will need to know: when SSTV signals will be transmitted; which transmitter on ISS will be used, usually it is one of these: Mode U - SSTV on 437.800 MHz; Mode V Imaging on 145.800 MHz; which SSTV mode will be used, usually it is either PD120 or PD180. In these modes the image transmission takes 120 s and 180 s respectively. In SkyRoof, select ARISS in the list of satellites, and the transmitter that is used in the current SSTV activity. When ISS rises above the horizon and its signals start to appear on the waterfall, the RX-SSTV or MMSSTV program automatically starts decoding the image. If for some reason it doesn't, click on the SSTV mode button (PD120 or PD180) to start it manually. Here is an example of an image received from ISS in July 2025.

Other versions may not work correctly. Run the downloaded file to install HamLib, note the folder where it is installed. Create a shortcut to start *rigctld.exe, with command line arguments: The arguments on the command line must be tailored for your specific radio and COM port settings. Refer to the rigctld documentation for a complete description of the arguments. Assuming that HamLib is installed in the default location, here is an example string for the shortcut: \"C:\\Program Files\\hamlib-w64-4.5.5\\bin\\rigctld.exe\" -m 3081 -r COM9 -s 115200 In the string above the following arguments are used: -m 3081 - the radio model is IC-9700; -r COM9 - the COM port used by the radio. In this case, the USB connection to IC-9700 creates two virtual COM ports, COM9 and COM10. The port with the lower number is used for CAT; -s 115200 - use the highest available COM port speed.

Increase the delay if your radio is slow; Log Traffic should be set to False and enabled only for debugging; Ignore Dial Knob - by default, CAT control allows you to change the frequency both in the program and by spinning the dial knob. If for some reason this causes trouble, change this setting to True, then the dial knob will be ignored. The two sections in the Settings, RX CAT and TX CAT, allow you to use either the same radio for RX and TX, or two different radios. You can also enable only one of those, or disable both. The recommended configuration is to use an SDR for reception and a transceiver for transmission, in this case RX CAT should be disabled. To use the same radio for RX and TX, set Host, TCP Port and Radio Type to the same values in both sections. To use two different radios, create a second shortcut for the second radio, and specify a different port number on the command line. Enter this port number in the settings as well, and run two instances of rigctld.exe using both shortcuts.

See the Setting Up CAT Control section for the instructions how to download and install HamLib. Create a shortcut to start *rotctld.exe, with command line arguments: The arguments on the command line must be tailored for your specific rotator and COM port settings. Refer to the rotctld documentation for a complete description of the arguments. Assuming that HamLib is installed in the default location, here is an example string for the shortcut: \"C:\\Program Files\\hamlib-w64-4.5.5\\bin\\rotctld.exe\" -m 601 -r COM12 -s 9600 In the string above the following arguments are used: -m 601 - the rotator model is Yaesu GS-232A; -r COM12 - the COM port used by the rotator; -s 9600 - the COM port speed. Run rotctld.exe using this shortcut before you enable rotator control in SkyRoof. Settings Click on Tools / Settings in the main menu to open the Settings dialog: Delay determines how often SkyRoof sends commands to the rotator. The default delay is 300 ms; Log Traffic should be set to False and enabled only for debugging; Enabled - enable or disable rotator control. Another way to toggle the rotator control is to click on the Rotator label on the status bar; Host - should be \"127.0.0.1\" or \"localhost\" if rotctld is running on the same computer as SkyRoof. It may be changed to a different address for remote control; TCP Port - 4533 is the default port used by rotctld; Minimum Azimuth, Maximum Azimuth, Minimum Elevation, Maximum Elevation - specify the range of values your rotator accepts; Azimuth Offset, Elevation Offset - if your rotator is not perfectly calibrated, these settings allow you to apply a correction; Step Size - to prevent the rotator from starting and stopping too often, change the bearing only when the required change is greater than the step size. The default value is 5 degrees. If your rotator does not control elevation, set the MinimumElevation and MaximumElevation to the same value. With such settings, wrong elevation will not be considered a bearing error. Note that the bearing error is indicated with a pink color on the Rotator Control panel."

    "summary": "Setting Up SDR Supported Radios SkyRoof uses the Soapy SDR engine to interface with the SDR radios. Currently it supports: Airspy; SDRplay; RTL-SDR; HackRF; PlutoSDR. Note It may be possible to add support of other SDR devices to SkyRoof. Contact me if you have an unsupported SDR and are willing to do extensive testing. Installing The Drivers Most of the SDR devices require the driver to be installed before you can start using them. Check the manufacturer's web site, or search on Google, for the driver installation instructions. At the time of this writing, the following instructions were available on the Web: Airspy, RTL-SDR, SDRplay, HackRF. Once you install the drivers and make your radio work with its native software, proceed to the next step. Selecting an SDR device Connect your SDR device to the computer, then click on Tools / SDR Devices in the main menu. This will open the SDR Devices dialog: All active SDR devices are listed on the left panel. Click on the one that you want to use. Configuring the device The right panel shows all settings that the device driver understands. The setting names and descriptions (shown on the bottom panel) come from the driver, with two exceptions described below. For information about these settings see the documentation that comes with the radio. The two settings, common to all radios, are: PPM - the correction factor for the SDR clock frequency, expressed in parts per million. This setting is important for the correct operation of the Doppler tracking algorithm, see the Calibrating PPM Correction section for details; Single Gain - when set to true (and AGC is off), the SDR gain is controlled by the RF Gain slider on the toolbar. This is the recommended setting. When it is set to false, the settings in the Stage Gains are applied to the individual stages of the SDR, and the gain slider is disabled. Using Remote SDR SkyRoof can use SDR devices connected to a remote (or local) computer via the SoapyRemote driver. To enable remote access to SDR: On the remote computer: install SoapySDR which is available as part of PothosSDR; run the remote server that comes with SoapySDR: SoapySDRServer.exe --bind In SkyRoof: enable SoapyRemote in the Settings dialog; enter the host name of the remote computer, or leave \"localhost\" if the radio is on the same computer. Open the SDR Devices dialog and select the remote SDR device from the list. If the device and remote server are on the localhost, you will have a choice between a direct connection to the radio and a connection via the server."

    "title": "SkyCAT v.1.4 | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "SkyCAT v.1.4 Note The documentation for SkyCAT is under development, these are just some notes for the beta testers. Overview SkyCAT is a new CAT control engine, open source and multi-platform. It is available as a .NET assembly that developers can include in their software, and also as a command-line program that accepts TCP commands compatible with rigctld.exe. Supported Radios This is the very first version of SkyCAT, it includes the command set files only for these radios: IC-9700 IC-705 IC-905 IC-706MKIIG FT-847 FT-817 TS-2000 Once the software is fully tested, the files for other radios will be added. Moreover, the users will be able to create their own files, just as in OmniRig. Quick tests have been performed by the beta testers with all radio models except FT-817. Please help me by testing SkyCAT with 817/818. Detailed tests, as described below in the What to Test section, still need to be performed with all radios. Again, I rely on you and other users for this since I do not have all those radios and cannot do the tests myself. Please help me with this if you can. Running skycatd.exe Download: skycat.zip There is no installer, just unzip all files in some folder. Use the same command line parameters as you used with rigctld.exe, e.g.: skycatd.exe -m 3081 -r COM9 -s 115200 -vvv -f the -s parameter is optional, the program knows the default speed of each radio; the -vvv option enables detailed logging; the new -f option enables writing the log to a file. Skycatd on Linux and Max Install .NET 9 Runtime On macOS: brew install dotnet On Linux (Ubuntu): sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-9.0 More distros here. Run the program: dotnet skycatd.dll Testing Please test SkyCAT with SkyRoof first. Later you can try it with other programs, such as GPredict. Configuration In the Settings dialog of SkyRoof, under CAT Control: Ignore Dial Knob: set to false; Delay: initially set to 300-1000 ms: with the default value of 100 ms it writes too many entries to the log. When you proceed to testing the dial knob, set it back to 100 ms for faster response (or longer than that if your radio cannot keep the pace); Radio Type: set to Duplex for IC-9700 and FT-847, and to Simplex for all other radios - both in the RX and TX sections; Host: if you are running skycatd on another computer, enter the Host name or IP address of that computer. Turn on the radio, run skycatd.exe, run SkyRoof - in any order. What to Test test the program with: RX CAT and TX CAT enabled; only TX enabled; only RX enabled. test with different satellite transmitters: SSB transponder; FM repeater; Digital (e.g., SONATE), where the uplink and downlink frequencies are on the same band; Telemetry or Beacon that has only a downlink frequency; switch between the V/U and U/V satellites to see if the band change works. Note that you do not have to wait for the satellite to rise, Doppler tracking works even if the satellite is not visible functions to test: the rx and tx frequencies should change in the radio with time as the Doppler offsets change; setting the rx and tx mode in SkyRoof should change the mode in the radio; tuning the rx frequency in SkyRoof with a mouse should change the rx frequency in the radio; changing the Uplink Manual Correction should change the tx frequency in the radio; spinning the dial knob should change the frequency in SkyRoof: if an SSB transponder is tracked, it should change the offset within the transponder segment; for as FM repeater, the Downlink manual correction should change; when transmitting, the dial knob should change the Uplink Manual Correction setting. press the Transmit button in the radio and see if the Transmit button in SkyRoof changes the text; press the Transmit button in SkyRoof to enable and disable transmission. Limitations Note Many radios cannot write or even read the frequency and mode, or at least change the band, when transmitting. This poses a problem in the Simplex mode because in this mode the software is responsible for writing the RX and TX frequency/mode to the radio when it switches from RX to TX and back. However, once the radio is in the TX mode, it is too late to set any parameters. If you see that your transceiver does not switch to the TX frequency when you press PTT in the radio, see if it works when you switch PTT using the Transmit button in SkyRoof, in this case the program has a chance to write the settings before the radio goes to the transmit mode. Reporting The Results Please let me know how skycat.exe works with your radio. If there are any issues, please describe them in detail. Please include your log files located in the folder where you put SkyCAT, in the Logs sub-folder. Send me the logs even if all works fine. Good to Know TCP Commands The following TCP commands are supported by skycatd.exe: -f and -F -i and -I -m and -M -x and -X -t and -T -U See the rigctld documentation for the description of these commands. Operating Modes Many radios have different CAT commands for the same operation, depending on the operating mode of the radio. An example is the Set Frequency command that is usually different in the SAT and VFO modes. Existing CAT software often uses wrong commands because it does not know the current operating mode. SatCAT sets this mode explicitly, so it knows which commands to use. The -U command is used to set up the radio in one of its operating modes: -U Duplex -U Split -U Simplex -U Transmitter -U Receiver For compatibility with rigctld.exe, the 'U SATMODE 1', 'S 1 VFOB' and 'S 0 VFOB' commands are recognized as aliases of the Duplex, Split and Simplex setup commands respectively."

    "title": "CAT command notes | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "CAT command notes While working on the SkyCAT engine, I discovered that the documentation for the CAT commands of many radios is incomplete and sometimes wrong. The only way to learn the actual behavior of the CAT system is by experimentation. Below are my notes that may help the people trying to use CAT commands in their software. IC-9700 \"16\", \"59\", \"00\" - this command that disables the dual watch mode sometimes returns success code \"FB\" and sometimes the error code, \"FA\". In both cases dual watch is disabled. I could not find any pattern in its response, just be prepared to ignore the error; \"\"05\" - set the operating frequency, fails in the SAT mode if the frequency is on the same band as that of the Sub receiver. The work around is, when it fails, to send the Swap A/B command, then set the frequency again. Note that the modes of the Main and Sub receive also get swapped and need to be re-set; \"\"05\" - if Split is enabled and we are setting the frequency of the selected VFO that is on a band other than the unselected VFO band, this command disables Split. However, if another frequency change returns to the previous band, the Split gets automatically enabled! It remembered all this time that we wanted Split, and enabled it when the VFO A and B were tuned to the same band. FT-847 this radio has the Split mode, and even allows it to be used in a cross-band manner, but does not have a CAT command to enable Split, nor does it even have a command to swap the VFO's. FT-817 \"F7\" - the TX status returned by this command has a PTT on/off flag in its 7-th bit. This is stated in the docs, but the values used for ON and OFF are not documented. It turns out that the logic is inverted here, 0 means ON and 1 means OFF; this radio returns a 1-byte reply to the Set commands, but this is not documented. The returned values are different, but it is not clear what they mean. IC-706MKIIG supports split operation but the only way to change the TX frequency is by swapping the VFO's - useless for SAT work\"; does not have commands to read or set PTT."

    "title": "Waterfall Display | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "Waterfall Display Using Waterfall Display The waterfall display and associated Frequency Scale is the central piece of SkyRoof that integrates most of the functions available in the application: The waterfall spans over 3 MHz of spectrum (depending on the SDR model) so that it covers the whole satellite segment, 435-438 MHz, on the 70 cm band. On the 2 m band the satellite segment is only 200 kHz wide, 145.8-146 MHz, so it also fits completely in the waterfall. Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel Pan by dragging the waterfall horizontally with your mouse A mouse-click on the waterfall display: tunes the SDR and external radio to a terrestrial signal or, if the frequency is within the transponder segment of a passing satellite, selects that satellite and sets the transponder offset to the clicked signal. A click on the Sliders button in the top left corner of the panel opens the sliders that adjust brightness, contrast and scrolling speed of the waterfall, and select a color palette: See Also Frequency Scale Doppler Tracking Waterfall Display Characteristics Finding and tracking satellite signals on the VHF and UHF bands is a difficult task. These signals are weak because the output power of most satellite transmitters is in the milliwatt range. The fact that an omnidirectional antenna needs to be used to receive all in-range satellites at the same time makes this task even more difficult. On top of that, we need to see the whole 3-MHz frequency segment where the satellite signals may appear, and at the same time we want a very high resolution to examine the structure of the signals, and to tune precisely to CW, SSB and digital transmissions. The waterfall display in SkyRoof solves these problems by computing power spectra oversampled by a factor of about 100. This has three important consequences: You can zoom in the waterfall display without changing its resolution in Settings, just by spinning the mouse wheel. When zoomed in to the maximum, you can see the signals with a 100x magnification (20 Hz resolution). When zoomed out to the maximum to see the whole 3-MHz segment, the sensitivity of the waterfall display to narrowband signals improves by about 15 dB due to oversampling. Spectrum oversampling, however, increases the requirements to the hardware: more CPU power is needed to compute very large spectra; more texture memory is needed in the video card to store the spectra; support of OpenGL 3.3 or higher is required for the zoom function. Please see the System Requirements section for the exact requirements. If your computer does not meet these requirements, you can still use the pass prediction, Doppler correction, radio control and rotator control functions in SkyRoof, just disable the SDR function and close the Waterfall Display panel."

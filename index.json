    "title": "Calibrating PPM Correction | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "Calibrating PPM Correction Motivation The clock frequency of an SDR, as it comes from the factory, is rarely accurate. Typical errors are in the range of a few PPM (parts per million), which translates to a tuning error of 1-2 Khz on the 70 cm band. For accurate tracking of the satellite signals this error must be calibrated out. The calibration process is simple, we just find a signal of known frequency, check on what frequecy it appears on the waterfall, and compute the PPM correction factor from the difference between the two. There are plenty of signals on the air that may be used for calibration, if one knows what to look for. One of such signals is the FCCH channel of a GSM downlink. This channel is located 67,708 Hz above the center frequency of a GSM channel, and the accuracy of its frequency is claimed to be better than 0.05 PPM. 3-rd Party Software For the RTL-SDR dongles you can use the Kalibrate utility that performs such calibration automatically. For other radios follow the steps below. Steps Find a strong GSM signal, or any other signal of known frequency. In my area one of such signals is present on 890.8 MHz. Click on the Downlink frequency display in the Frequency Control panel on the toolbar to open the frequency entry dialog: Enter the frequency of the channel plus the FCCH offset: 890,800,000 + 67,708 = 890,867,708 Hz Click on the Tune button in the dialog and verify that the SDR is tuned to the desired frequency: Zoom in by spinning the mouse wheel over the waterfall display: Find the FCCH signal. On the screenshot below it is about 4 kHz above the expected frequency: Now let us measure the offset between the receiver frequency (the center of the green rectangle that represents the receiver passband) and the FCCH frequency. Tick the RIT checkbox on the Frequency Control panel and adjust the RIT offset until the RIT passband (the clear rectangle) aligns with the signal. You can tune RIT in many different ways, as described in the Frequency Control and Frequency Scale sections. For now, just use the up/down buttons in the RIT offset box, or spin the mouse wheel over that box. Compute the PPM correction. The frequency error measured in the previous step is 3,760 Hz, so the PPM is: 3,760 / 890,867,708 * 1e6 = 4.22 PPM Now enter this value in the SDR Devices dialog, and you are done."

    "summary": "Configuring the Window Layout The layout of SkyRoof's main window is under your full control. Any panel may be shown or hidden, docked anywhere in the window, or left floating. Show and Hide Show the panels using the menu commands in the View section, hide them using the same command again, or by clicking on the Close button on panel's caption bar. Docking The panels you open are initially in the floating state. This is not very convenient as you cannot move or resize the main window without breaking your panel arrangement. You can dock the panels so that they move and resize when you move/resize the main window. How to Dock a Floating Panel The Timeline panel in the screenshot below is floating. Let us dock it to the bottom of the main window. Find the Panel's Title Bar Locate the top bar of the floating panel labeled \"Timeline\". This is known as the title bar. Click and Hold Move your mouse cursor to the title bar and press the left mouse button. Keep holding the button down. Drag the Panel While holding the mouse button, move the panel by dragging it with the mouse. As you begin to drag, you will see dock target icons appear in the main window—these icons represent the available docking positions. You will also notice a dimmed rectangle showing where the panel would be docked if released. ⚠️ Important: This rectangle is only a visual preview. Do not try to align it with the dock target icon. Instead, focus on where your mouse cursor is. Position the Mouse Cursor Over a Dock Target Icon Move your mouse cursor over one of the dock target icons (not the rectangle). The docking location will update automatically. The panel will only dock if the cursor is directly over the icon. Release to Dock Once the cursor is over your desired dock target icon, release the mouse button. The panel will snap into place — either at the side, in the center, or nested inside another panel, depending on the selected icon. Once docked, the panel becomes part of the main window layout, helping keep your workspace clean and organized. Auto-Hide A panel can be switched to the auto-hide mode, which allows it to stay hidden until you click on its tab. In the screenshot below, notice the \"Timeline\" tab in the bottom-left corner. Clicking this tab temporarily slides the Timeline panel into view. To enable auto-hide mode, click the Auto-Hide button located on the panel’s title bar. Tabbing You can also organize panels as tabs. If you drop one panel directly onto another, they will be grouped into a tabbed interface. In the screenshot below the Sky View Panel and Earth View Panel have been combined into a tabbed view. You can switch between these panels by clicking on their respective tabs."

    "summary": "Doppler Tracking The SGP4 algorithm used in SkyRoof to compute the Doppler offset produces very accurate results for the LEO satellites, typically within tens of Hertz, if it receives accurate input data. For best results, ensure that the following conditions are met. Home Location Make sure that your grid square is accurate. Correct it in the Settings window if necessary. System Time Your system clock should be accurate to a second. Get one of those little programs that run in the system tray and periodically synchronize your clock with the time servers on the Internet. NetTime is one such program. PPM correction Find the PPM correction factor of your SDR radio as described in the Calibrating PPM Correction section and enter it in SDR settings. TLE Data SkyRoof downloads the TLE data automatically every 24 hours. Some sources claim that TLE may be updated once a week, but that would not be enough for accurate Doppler tracking, especially for the satellites that perform frequent orbit corrections. When in doubt, download TLE manually as described in the Satellite Data section. Transmitter Frequency Correction Most satellite transmitters transmit on the frequencies that differ from the nominal values by up to a few kHz.

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "Frequently Asked Questions Q: I downloaded SkyRoof, and my virus scanner shows an infection. Is it real? A: Most likely, it is a false detection. However, it is always a good idea to test the download links before downloading any software. There are several online virus scanning services that you can use to check the link. VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis are just two examples. Copy the download link and paste it in the virus scanner page. The scanner will download the file, test it with multiple antivirus programs, and show you the results. In the screenshot below the download link of SkyRoof 1.5 beta was tested with VirtusTotal, and all virus scanners, except one, agreed that the file was clean. When you see something like this, you know that it was a false alarm. If the file is clean, you can add it to the exception list of your virus scanner and safely install it. For Windows Defender follow these instructions, for other anti-virus products follow the instructions in their documentation. Q: The right part of the SkyRoof toolbar does not fit in the screen, even though the screen resolution is 1980x1280. A: This happens because your text size setting in Windows is too high. For example, if it is set to 200%, the effective screen width is only 1900 / 2 = 950 pixels. To fix this, right-click on the Desktop, click on Display Settings and set the text size to a lower value. Q: How can I run two instances of SkyRoof? A: By default, only one instance of SkyRoof can run at any time, but there is a work around. Make a copy of the SkyRoof.exe file in the same folder, but with a different name, e.g., SkyRoof_2.exe. Each exe will have its own settings, its own data folder, and will run independently of the other instance. Q: I found an error in the satellite database: one of the satellite transmitters is marked as active, while it has been inactive for years. How can I correct the error? A: SkyRoof uses satellite data from the SatNOGS database. This database is crowd-sourced, so anyone can suggest changes. If you find an error in a satellite record (shown in the Satellite Details and Satellite Transmitters panels), click on the \"SatNOGS\" link in the Satellite Details panel to open the SatNOGS web site, then click on Transmitters, and select Edit from the drop-down menu. You may need to create an account with them (free) in order to submit changes."

    "title": "Frequency Control | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "Frequency Control Frequency Control is the panel on the toolbar that allows you to read and control the frequencies of the SDR receiver, external receiver and external transmitter: Downlink The left hand part of the panel represents the receiver settings that apply to both SDR and external radio. Label When the receiver is tuned to a downlink transmitter of some satellite, the label \"Downlink\" appears; when it is tuned to a terrestrial station, the label \"Terrestrial\" is displayed. To tune to a downlink, select some satellite in the Satellite Selector panel, or select a different transmitter from the drop-down list, or click on the satellite name in any panel. To tune to a terrestrial signal, click on it on the Waterfall Display or on the Frequency Scale, or click on the downlink frequency display and enter the frequency in the Tune to Frequency window: Mode Select the mode manually for every satellite transmitter that you are using. Your selection is remembered and restored when the transmitter is selected again. The Mode selected in the drop-down box applies to the SDR receiver, if it is enabled, and to the external receiver, if RX CAT is enabled. To enable or disable the SDR or RX CAT, click on the corresponding label on the status bar. Frequency Display The frequency display shows either the nominal frequency of the downlink, or the frequency with all corrections applied. Right-click on the display to switch between the two frequencies. The mouse tooltip of the frequency display shows both frequencies and some other details. When RX CAT is enabled and working properly, the frequency is shown in a bright color, otherwise the display is dimmed. The color depends on the band: yellow/olive for VHF, cyan/teal for UHF, white/gray for all other bands. Doppler The Doppler box shows the current Doppler offset of the downlink signal. This value is not editable, but Doppler correction may be enabled or disabled using the checkbox. See the Doppler Tracking section for a detailed discussion of Doppler offset calculation and tracking. Manual The manual correction of the downlink frequency. The frequencies of the satellite downlink signals usually differ from the nominal values in the database, for different reasons, by a few hundred Hertz and up to a couple of kilohertz. This difference is pretty stable, so it is enough to enter the correction once to have the receiver accurately tuned. SkyRoof remembers the manual correction for each satellite. The value of the manual correction may be entered in the Manual box by clicking on the up/down buttons, or by spinning the mouse wheel over the box, or by typing the value directly. However, it is more convenient to adjust the correction visually, using the mouse on the Frequency Scale. The checkbox allows you to disable the manual correction if necessary. RIT The RIT function is useful when listening to a conversation of two stations that are not exactly on the same frequency, or when your CQ is answered off the frequency. The RIT offset may be entered in the RIT box, but it is more convenient to control it on the Frequency Scale. Use the checkbox, or the commands on the Frequency Scale, to toggle RIT. Uplink The Uplink part of the panel is similar to the Downlink part described above. It is enabled only if the selected satellite transmitter has an uplink. The bright color of the frequency display means that TX CAT is enabled and working properly. The Transmit button switches the external radio between the RX and TX modes. The Manual Correction setting of the uplink allows you to align your transmit and receive frequencies. See the Frequency Scale section for details. Dial Knob The dial knob of the transceiver can be used to tune the frequency when CAT control is enabled and the Ignore Dial Knob option is set to false. When both RX CAT and TX CAT are enabled, the dial knob controls the receiver frequency. Note When the radio is in the SAT mode, the NOR/REV switch should be in the NOR position for correct tuning with the dial knob."

    "summary": "Frequency Scale The frequency scale appears on the Waterfall Display panel, above the waterfall: Satellite Transmitters The Doppler-corrected frequencies of the satellite transmitters are marked on the frequency scale with small triangles, labeled with the satellite names: green triangles - the satellites that are currently above the horizon; white triangles - the satellites that will rise in the next 5 minutes; gray triangles - the satellites that are already below the horizon, but whose signals are still may be visible on the waterfall; blue rectangles - the transponder segments of the satellites above the horizon; gray rectangles - the transponder segments of the satellites below the horizon. The names of the satellites that belong to the current group are shown in bold; The current transmitter has its satellite name on the light blue background. Move the mouse cursor over a satellite name to see the details on the mouse tooltip. Right-click on a satellite name to open the popup menu with these commands: Select Transmitter - if the satellite has more than one transmitter on the same frequency, this command is enabled and allows you to set one of the transmitters as selected; Add to Group - add the satellite to one of the existing groups; Report to AMSAT - open the dialog to report your observation of this satellite to AMSAT Live OSCAR Satellite Status Page Satellite Details - opens the Satellite Details window SDR Receiver The passband of the SDR receiver is shown on the frequency scale as a green rectangle. To tune the receiver: click on one of the satellite labels to start tracking satellite's transmitter; click within a blue transponder segment to select the transmitter and set the transponder offset; click anywhere on the frequency scale to tune to a terrestrial signal; drag the green rectangle to another frequency with a mouse; spin the mouse wheel on or near the green rectangle. The effect of tuning depends on the transmitter selection: when tuned to a terrestrial signal, tuning the SDR receiver just changes the receiver frequency; when a satellite transmitter is tracked, tuning adjusts the Manual Offset of the satellite (see below); if a satellite transponder is selected, tuning changes the receiver offset within the transponder segment. Another way to tune the SDR receiver is to use the Frequency Control on the toolbar. If RX CAT is enabled, tuning the SDR receiver also tunes the external radio to the same frequency. Note Get a mouse with a free-spinning wheel, such as Logitech MX Master 3S, this makes tuning much easier. Manual Offset The Manual Offset setting compensates for the transmitter frequency error, see Frequency Control and Doppler Tracking for details. The offset value is usually the same for all transmitters of a satellite, adjust it for some non-transponder transmitter before using the transponder. Most satellites with a transponder also carry a telemetry or beacon transmitter that you can use to set the manual offset: Aligning The Uplink and Downlink Frequencies The screenshot below shows how to set Manual Correction for the uplink and downlink for a linear transponder, such as RS-44. Select the beacon transmitter of the satellite and adjust the Downlink Manual Correction setting to align the transmitter label and its signal trace on the waterfall. For RS-44 the required correction is about -1900 Hz. If your offset is different, then yor SDR requires PPM calibration. Select the transponder transmitter and find a clear frequency within the transponder segment. Send a sequence of dots and adjust the Uplink Manual Correction to align the center of the green rectangle with the trace of your signals coming from the satellite. These adjustments need to be done only once. They stay the same, within a few tens of Hertz, between the satellite passes. When TX CAT is enabled, RX CAT is disabled and the Ignore Dial Knob is set to false in the Settings, it is possible to adjust the Uplink Manual Offset using the dial knob on the radio. RIT While the RIT function could be controlled using the Frequency Control panel, it is more convenient to do this on the frequency scale: When RIT is enabled, the clear rectangle shows the current receiver passband, while the green rectangle stays on the main frequency. spin the mouse wheel on or near the green rectangle while holding the Ctrl key down: this enables RIT and tunes its offset; spin the mouse wheel on or near the green rectangle WITHOUT holding the Ctrl key down: this disables RIT and tunes the main frequency; right-click on or near the green rectangle to turn RIT on and off.

Download hamlib-w64-4.5.5.exe from GitHub. Other versions may not work correctly. Run the downloaded file to install HamLib, note the folder where it is installed. Create a shortcut to start *rigctld.exe, with command line arguments: The arguments on the command line must be tailored for your specific radio and COM port settings. Refer to the rigctld documentation for a complete description of the arguments. Assuming that HamLib is installed in the default location, here is an example string for the shortcut: \"C:\\Program Files\\hamlib-w64-4.5.5\\bin\\rigctld.exe\" -m 3081 -r COM9 -s 115200 In the string above the following arguments are used: -m 3081 - the radio model is IC-9700; -r COM9 - the COM port used by the radio. In this case, the USB connection to IC-9700 creates two virtual COM ports, COM9 and COM10. The port with the lower number is used for CAT; -s 115200 - use the highest available COM port speed.

Settings Click on Tools / Settings in the main menu to open the Settings dialog: Delay determines how often SkyRoof sends commands to the radio. The default delay of 100 ms is good in most cases. Increase the delay if your radio is slow; Log Traffic should be set to False and enabled only for debugging; Ignore Dial Knob - by default, CAT control allows you to change the frequency both in the program and by spinning the dial knob. If for some reason this causes trouble, change this setting to True, then the dial knob will be ignored. The two sections in the Settings, RX CAT and TX CAT, allow you to use either the same radio for RX and TX, or two different radios. You can also enable only one of those, or disable both. The recommended configuration is to use an SDR for reception and a transceiver for transmission, in this case RX CAT should be disabled. To use the same radio for RX and TX, set Host, TCP Port and Radio Type to the same values in both sections. To use two different radios, create a second shortcut for the second radio, and specify a different port number on the command line. Enter this port number in the settings as well, and run two instances of rigctld.exe using both shortcuts. The settings in the RX and TX sections are: Host - should be \"127.0.0.1\" or \"localhost\" if rigctld is running on the same computer as SkyRoof. It may be changed to a different address for remote control; TCP Port - 4532 is the default port used by rigctld. Use a different port in one of the sections to control different radios for RX and TX; Enabled - enable or disable CAT. Another way to toggle CAT is to click on the CAT labels on the status bar: Radio Type - as mentioned above, the beta version has been tested only with IC-9700, which is a duplex transceiver. Change this setting if you want to test a radio of a different type; Show Corrected Frequency - The SkyRoof can display either the nominal frequency of the satellite transmitter, or the frequency with all corrections applied.

    "summary": "Setting Up SDR Supported Radios SkyRoof uses the Soapy SDR engine to interface with the SDR radios. Currently it supports: Airspy; SDRplay; RTL-SDR; HackRF. Note It may be possible to add support of other SDR devices to SkyRoof. Contact me if you have an unsupported SDR and are willing to do extensive testing. Installing The Drivers Most of the SDR devices require the driver to be installed before you can start using them. Check the manufacturer's web site, or search on Google, for the driver installation instructions. At the time of this writing, the following instructions were available on the Web: Airspy, RTL-SDR, SDRplay, HackRF. Once you install the drivers and make your radio work with its native software, proceed to the next step. Selecting an SDR device Connect your SDR device to the computer, then click on Tools / SDR Devices in the main menu. This will open the SDR Devices dialog: All active SDR devices are listed on the left panel. Click on the one that you want to use. Configuring the device The right panel shows all settings that the device driver understands. The setting names and descriptions (shown on the bottom panel) come from the driver, with two exceptions described below. For information about these settings see the documentation that comes with the radio. The two settings, common to all radios, are: PPM - the correction factor for the SDR clock frequency, expressed in parts per million. This setting is important for the correct operation of the Doppler tracking algorithm, see the Calibrating PPM Correction section for details; Single Gain - when set to true (and AGC is off), the SDR gain is controlled by the RF Gain slider on the toolbar. This is the recommended setting. When it is set to false, the settings in the Stage Gains are applied to the individual stages of the SDR, and the gain slider is disabled. Using Remote SDR SkyRoof can use SDR devices connected to a remote computer via the SoapyRemote driver. To enable remote access to SDR: On the remote computer: install the SoapySDRServer that comes with SoapySDR and run it. In SkyRoof: enable SoapyRemote in the Settings dialog; enter the host and port number of the remote computer. Open the SDR Devices dialog and select one of the remote SDR devices from the list."

    "title": "Waterfall Display | SkyRoof",
    "summary": "Waterfall Display Using Waterfall Display The waterfall display and associated Frequency Scale is the central piece of SkyRoof that integrates most of the functions available in the application: The waterfall spans over 3 MHz of spectrum (depending on the SDR model) so that it covers the whole satellite segment, 435-438 MHz, on the 70 cm band. On the 2 m band the satellite segment is only 200 kHz wide, 145.8-146 MHz, so it also fits completely in the waterfall. Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel Pan by dragging the waterfall horizontally with your mouse A mouse-click on the waterfall display: tunes the SDR and external radio to a terrestrial signal or, if the frequency is within the transponder segment of a passing satellite, selects that satellite and sets the transponder offset to the clicked signal. A click on the Sliders button in the top left corner of the panel opens the sliders that adjust brightness, contrast and scrolling speed of the waterfall, and select a color palette: See Also Frequency Scale Doppler Tracking Waterfall Display Characteristics Finding and tracking satellite signals on the VHF and UHF bands is a difficult task. These signals are weak because the output power of most satellite transmitters is in the milliwatt range. The fact that an omnidirectional antenna needs to be used to receive all in-range satellites at the same time makes this task even more difficult. On top of that, we need to see the whole 3-MHz frequency segment where the satellite signals may appear, and at the same time we want a very high resolution to examine the structure of the signals, and to tune precisely to CW, SSB and digital transmissions. The waterfall display in SkyRoof solves these problems by computing power spectra oversampled by a factor of about 100. This has three important consequences: You can zoom in the waterfall display without changing its resolution in Settings, just by spinning the mouse wheel. When zoomed in to the maximum, you can see the signals with a 100x magnification (20 Hz resolution). When zoomed out to the maximum to see the whole 3-MHz segment, the sensitivity of the waterfall display to narrowband signals improves by about 15 dB due to oversampling. Spectrum oversampling, however, increases the requirements to the hardware: more CPU power is needed to compute very large spectra; more texture memory is needed in the video card to store the spectra; support of OpenGL 3.3 or higher is required for the zoom function. Please see the System Requirements section for the exact requirements. If your computer does not meet these requirements, you can still use the pass prediction, Doppler correction, radio control and rotator control functions in SkyRoof, just disable the SDR function and close the Waterfall Display panel."
